    "This involves the computation of indices (https://github.com/csdms-contrib/slepian_alpha/blob/master/wignersort.m) which assigns a unique index for a unique wigner. However, it is noted that the computation of the index itself is quite expensive, albeit very cheap when compared to the computation of the wigners themselves. For our use-case in `qdPy`, this could potentially be simplified as the wigners always have the same structure. For the problem of rotation, the wigners are always written as $(\\ell, s, \\ell')$ in the numerator and $(-m, 0, m)$ in the denominator. This ensures that we could eliminate the need to account for the redundancy due to cyclical combinations of the parameters. "

Defining $\\Delta\\ell = \\ell' - \\ell$, we can write the parameters into two sets of pairs $(\\ell, m)$ and $(s, \\Delta\\ell)$. Because of the selection rules, we already know that $\\Delta\\ell \\le s$ and hence, the $(s, \\Delta\\ell)$ pair could be quantified in the same way as the $(\\ell, m)$ pair. It is well known that \n",
